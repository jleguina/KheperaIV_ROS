# Differential game theory for multi-agent collision avoidance. Simulations set up.
Set up of the simulations infrastructure for the implementation of [1-2]. The main contributions of this project are:
1. Implementation of offline centralised and decentralised collision-avoidance path planning algorithms via linear-quadratic differential games. 
2. Generalisation of the decentralised planner to online operation.
3. A nested feedback-LQR controller for trajectory following of a non-holonomic robot.
4. Odometry tracking though sensor fusion with extended Kalman filtering. 
5. The first known Gazebo model of the KheperaIV robot.
